# openVFS - a Virtual File Sytem for Cloud Storage

openVFS is a framework to provide virtual files for the free desktop. It is based on the [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)-filesystem layer to provide virtual files for the free desktop.

This is **experimental** code that is based on the nice work from RÃ©mi Flament - remipouak at gmail.com called LoggedFS which is a filesystem monitoring system. This was considered useful and choosen as a base of the openVFS work.

Please feel free to create PRs or engage in the discussion.

## Simplest usage

To start the openvfs and record access to `/tmp/TEST` into `~/log.txt`, just do:

    openvfsfuse -l ~/log.txt /tmp/TEST

To stop recording, just `unmount` as usual:

    sudo umount /tmp/TEST

The `~/log.txt` file will need to be changed to readable by setting permissions:

    chmod 0666 ~/log.txt

## Installation from source

First you have to make sure that FUSE is installed on your computer.
If you have a recent distribution it should be. FUSE can be downloaded here: [github.com/libfuse/libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).

openVFS has the following dependencies:

    fuse
    pcre2
    libxml2

## Configuration

openvfsfuse can use an XML configuration file if you want it to log operations only for certain files, for certain users, or for certain operations.

Here is a sample configuration file :

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <loggedFS logEnabled="true" printProcessName="true">
      <includes>
        <include extension=".*" uid="*" action=".*" retname=".*"/>
      </includes>
      <excludes>
        <exclude extension=".*\.bak$" uid="*" action=".*" retname="SUCCESS"/>
        <exclude extension=".*" uid="1000" action=".*" retname="FAILURE"/>
        <exclude extension=".*" uid="*" action="getattr" retname=".*"/>
      </excludes>
    </loggedFS>

This configuration can be used to log everything except it if concerns a `*.bak` file, or if the uid is 1000, or if the operation is `getattr`.

## Launching openvfsfuse

If you just want to test openvfsfuse you don't need any configuration file.

Just use that command:

    openvfsfuse -f -p /var

You should see logs like these :

    tail -f /var/log/syslog

If you have a configuration file to use you should use this command:

    ./openvfsfuse -c openvfsfuse.xml -p /var

If you want to log what other users do on your filesystem, you should use the `-p` option to allow them to see your mounted files. For a complete documentation see the manual page.
